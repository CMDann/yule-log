# [Yule Log](https://github.com/CMDann/YuleLog)

This is a simple HTML5 Yule log fireplace page for your festive pleasure. This is using the HTML5 boiler plate and some resources that give you a nice experiance. This was whipped up for my girlfriend because she is pretty into the yule log while studying.

Boiler plate credit goes it the HTML5 boiler plate which I used because I am lazy. You will get a full screen fireplace with sound on repeat.
